# GitHub Copilot Instructions for D2Lang Projects

This document provides guidance for configuring and using GitHub Copilot effectively in projects utilizing D2Lang, a diagramming language designed for creating structured diagrams. The instructions aim to optimize Copilot's autocompletion and suggestion capabilities for D2Lang syntax, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant suggestions for diagrams like the provided AWS Organizations sample.

## Best Practices for D2Lang with Copilot
- **Modularize Diagrams**: Break large diagrams into smaller files or blocks to improve Copilot's context understanding.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for nodes to help Copilot predict similar node names.
- **Validate Syntax**: Regularly validate D2 files using the D2 CLI to catch errors that might confuse Copilot.
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Specify `shape`, `label`, and `style` explicitly to guide Copilot toward precise suggestions.
- **Comment Extensively**: Add comments to explain complex relationships or configurations, helping Copilot provide relevant completions.

## Additional Resources
- **D2 Documentation**: Refer to the official D2Lang documentation (https://d2lang.com) for syntax details.
- **Icon Libraries**: Use consistent icon sources like https://icons.terrastruct.com for AWS-related diagrams.
